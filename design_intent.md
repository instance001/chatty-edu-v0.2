# Design Intent

This document explains what Chatty-EDU is designed to support — and just as importantly, what it is deliberately **not** designed to do.

The goal of the system is to reduce shame, judgment, and unnecessary pressure across learning environments, while supporting early, dignity-preserving intervention and understanding.


Teacher Use Boundary

This system is designed to support teachers’ private professional judgment and classroom-level decision-making. It is not intended, designed, or validated for staff evaluation, ranking, performance measurement, or compliance monitoring.

Student Use Boundary

This system is designed to support learning, early support, and dignity-preserving intervention. It is not intended to label, rank, shame, permanently profile, discipline, or surveil students.

Parent Use Boundary

This system is designed to support learning and understanding during homework and revision. It is not intended to act as an authority over the student, replace teacher judgment, or function as a mechanism for parental monitoring, pressure, or comparison.

Across all contexts, the system is designed to illuminate learning needs — not to intensify scrutiny, judgment, or pressure on any individual.
